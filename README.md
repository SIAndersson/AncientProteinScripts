`hallucination_run.py` needs to be placed in the root directory of `RFDiffusion`. This script is the main script for running both diffusion and restricted sequence design. There are hard-coded paths in the script that will need to be changed if one wishes to run these scripts.

NOTE: This project only contains the dependencies to run the scripts in this folder. For RFdiffusion and ProteinMPNN, please follow the install instructions in their respective directories.
